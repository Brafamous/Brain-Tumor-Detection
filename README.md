# Brain Tumor Detection Using Machine Learning

A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in the brain or central spine that can disrupt proper brain function. It is the abnormal growth of tissues in brain. If the tumor originates in the brain, it is called a primary brain tumor. Primary brain tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign brain tumors are not cancerous.

### Project Scope

The Brain Tumor Detection Project is an artificial intelligence project designed to detect the presence of brain tumors in medical images such as MRI scans. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze the images and classify them as either having a tumor or being tumor-free.
